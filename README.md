# MNIST-2D-contours-dataset


For testing the DeepGCSS model  we first use MNIST dig-
its dataset in order to compare our results with ContourCNN
that chooses to use this same set. For extracting contours
from this image datasets, we use (algorithm1) where we call
bwboundaries function implemented in Matlab.
